# Deep Learning Model for Emotion Recognition via fMRI-Drived Brain Data

Methods We applied Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to fMRI-derived beta-series matrices of dimension ۹۰×۳۷۱۳۰ corresponding to ۹۰ stimuli and ۳۷۱۳۰ gray-matter voxels to predict the normative valence and arousal scores (in ۹-point Likert scale) of affective stimuli. We also used our model as a classifier to classify each stimulus responses into two categories: high/low arousal and positive/negative valence. 


## Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks 
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are a type of recurrent neural network that are used in this project to process the fMRI driven brain data. They are able to remember information over long periods of time, making them well suited for this task. 


## Conclusion 
This project is focused on developing a deep learning model for emotion recognition from fMRI driven brain data. The model will use Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and prediction and classification algorithms to accurately identify emotions from brain data.
